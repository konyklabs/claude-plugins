"""Lint and export the human-readable Markdown test cases.

The cases are the half of a sign-off a person reads: one file per case under
``testcases/<area>/TC-<area>-<nnn>.md``, written by hand, parsed here. The
skeleton, the metadata keys and the export column names live in
``plugins/signoff/formats.md`` and are not restated in this file's prose; this
script is their implementation.

Usage:
    cases.py check <testcases dir> [--tiles .qa/tiles.json] [--tests .qa/tests.json]
    cases.py export --format azure-csv|gherkin|markdown <testcases dir> --out <path>
                    [--tiles ...] [--tests ...]
    cases.py index <testcases dir>

``check`` prints one line per finding, ``path:line rule: reason``, then a
summary line; exit 1 when anything was found, 0 when clean, 2 when an input
could not be read (fail closed: a tiles file that will not parse is never a
pass). ``export`` runs the same check first and refuses (exit 1) when it would
fail, so a broken case never reaches a test-management tool. ``index`` prints
the JSON another script consumes.

The rules ``check`` can report, all of them:

    title-line          the first non-blank line is not `# <id>: <title>`
    bad-id              the id in the title line is not TC-<area>-<nnn>
    title-id-mismatch   that id is not the file's name
    duplicate-id        two files carry the same id
    missing-metadata    a key of the fixed metadata list is absent
    metadata-order      the keys are present but not in the fixed order
    duplicate-metadata  a key appears twice
    unknown-metadata    a key that is not one of the six
    stray-metadata      a line in the metadata block that is not `- key: value`
    bad-area            `area` is not the kebab-case identifier formats.md fixes
    bad-value           a value outside its allowed set, or empty where required
    automated-mismatch  `automated` is set on a case that is not automated,
                        or empty on one that is
    missing-section     `## Preconditions` or `## Steps` is absent
    section-order       `## Steps` comes before `## Preconditions`
    empty-preconditions the preconditions list has no items (`- none` is one)
    empty-steps         the steps table has no data row
    bad-table           the steps table has no `|---|` separator row
    bad-table-row       a step row has fewer than three columns
    empty-cell          a step's action or expected is empty
    too-large           the file is past the size a written case can be
    unreadable          the file could not be read at all
    dangling-tile       (--tiles) a tile the case names is not in tiles.json
    dangling-test       (--tests) an `automated` id is not in tests.json
    test-tile-mismatch  (--tests) that test claims none of the case's tiles
    uncased-tile        (--tiles) a covered tile no case names, reported once
                        per tile at `<tiles path>:0`

Standard library only, no network: this reads and writes files and nothing else.
